# wasm-compilation-pipeline

This is a basic boilerplate project for C library compilation to wasm using emscripten

# Roadmap

- Add a "How to use" section to the `README.md`
- Adding different tags to link commonly used libraries
- Generating the module boilerplate ourselves so we can use other compiler than emscripten
